# Big-Data-Processing
Everyday, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created and 90% of the data in the world today was created within the past two years! [IBM corporation]  
To manage these data with high volume, complexity and velocity, Pyspark and Kafka are used to explore the data and convert it into useful information.  
Each folder in the repository explores a different aspect of big data.
